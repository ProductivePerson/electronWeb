# Personal Coding Challenge

**Design an application that displays the last ten bitcoin transactions**

This app uses three main dependencies:
 - React for
 - jQueryFlipster for the fun carousel display style
 - Axios to server API calls
 - Gulp for compiling React code and automating deployment

**Design Decisions**

I wanted to convert my previous Electron app into a React app to understand
more about what it takes to transfer applications from stack to stack.  I also
wanted to be able to deploy my application to the web for review.

**File Structure**
- `main.js` - Starts the server
- `index.html` - Contains anchor targets for the apps **renderer process**.
- `server/config.js` - Express routes and bitcoin API calls
- `src/app.jsx` - contains React application and logic
